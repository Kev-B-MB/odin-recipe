    <h1> Hot Water </h1>
    <img src="water.png" alt="very hot water">
    <h2> You're going to want to let this water cool down.</h2>
    <p> Sometimes you need to drink water that is slightly warmer than room temperature.</p>
    <p> I think my great aunt's boyfriend's recipe will do the trick</p>
    <ol>
        <li> Pour some water into a pot, does not matter how much </li>
        <li> Turn the stove on to high heat</li>
        <li> Put pot with water in it on to hot stovetop </li>
        <li> Wait until water is hot, if water is boiling you went too far and disrespected my family recipe </li>
    </ol>
